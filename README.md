After the acquired knowledge in the Computer Systems course and work at weekend workshops at the King ICT Academy, I designed, implemented and programmed the Clinic Management System application using C# and basic knowledge of SQL databases. The application consists of 7 forms, of which the Login panel appears first.

After successful logging in, the front page is opened to the user, depending on the powers assigned to him.

Ater typing in the patient's data, medications, tests etc., the data is saved in the sql database.

Also there is form which has only dropdown with test names and after selecting one of them the price is pulled from database table and printed out. Finally, the diagnosis can also be typed and assigned to selected person and printed in to the text format.
